! Now distribute the changes equally to the four corners of each
! cell (nodes). Each interior grid point receives one quarter of the change

! Now deal with the changes to the upper and lower boundaries.
! These receive half the change from each of the two cells adjacent to them.

      do i=2,ni-1

        prop_inc(i,1) = 0.5 * (delprop(i,1) + delprop(i-1,1))

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the nodes with j=nj.
        prop_inc(i,nj) = 0.5 * (delprop(i,nj-1) + delprop(i-1,nj-1))

      enddo

! Now deal with changes to the inlet & outlet boundary points.
! These receive half the change from each of the two cells adjacent to them.

      do j=2,nj-1

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the nodes with i=ni.
        prop_inc(ni,j) = 0.5 * (delprop(ni-1,j) + delprop(ni-1,j-1))

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the nodes with i=1.
        prop_inc(1,j) = 0.5 * (delprop(1,j) + delprop(1,j-1))

      enddo

! Finally find the changes to be added to the four corner points.
! These receive the full change from the single cell of which they form one corner.

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the node with i=1,j=1.
     prop_inc(1,1) = delprop(1,1)

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the node with i=1,j=nj.
     prop_inc(1,nj) = delprop(1,nj-1)

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the node with i=ni,j=1.
     prop_inc(ni,1) = delprop(ni-1,1)

! INSERT your code here to calculate "prop_inc" for the node with i=ni,j=nj.
     prop_inc(ni,nj)  = delprop(ni-1,nj-1)

! If the values in delprop have been hi-jacked by the second order timestep extension,
! restore them here to the true residuals. (The second order extension should have
! loaded them into the variable "store" bwfore hi-jacking them)
! These are used in the convergence check and also in future improvements to the scheme.
