      subroutine set_timestep

      implicit none

! Local stuff
      real  ::  umax

! Tthis subroutine sets the length of the time step based on the
! stagnation speed of sound "astag" and the minimum length scale
! of any element, "dmin". The timestep must be called "deltat"

! An assumption that the maximum flow speed will be equal to "astag"
! is also made. This will be pessimistic for subsonic flows
! but may be optimistic for supersonic flows. In the latter case the
! length of the time step as determined by "cfl" may need to be reduced.

! The cfl number was input as data in data set "flow"

      astag  = sqrt(gamma*rgas*tstagin)
      umax   = astag

! INSERT your code here

    deltat = cfl * dmin/(umax+astag)
    
      end
